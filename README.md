# SimJava

The journey to creating this compiler:-

1. Define a lexical structure and implement a scanner for it.
2. Design a Context-Free Grammar and implement a recursive-descent parser for it.
3. Make your parser return an Abstract-Syntax Tree.
4. Implement a Leblanc-Cook symbol table for scoping rules.
5. Code generation to help create class file for the compiler to understand.
